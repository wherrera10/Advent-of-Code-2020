The weather routing problem has the following parts:

a predicted surface wind direction and speed, at increments of longitude, latitude, and time
an expected surface current direction and speed, at increments of longitude, latitude, and time
'polar data' describing maximum speed of a sailboat at points of sail for a given speed of wind over water
regions for sailing (the open ocean) and not (the land, shallows, restricted areas, etc.)
a starting location and time, and a destination
Given the above information and a specific path, progress and arrival time are determined. 
The weather routing problem, conversely, is to determine the path which results in the earliest arrival time.
