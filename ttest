{{draft task|Jaro-Winkler Distance}}

The Jaro-Winkler distance is a metric for measuring the edit distance between words.
It is similar to the more basic Levenstein distance but the Jaro distance also accounts
for transpositions between letters in the words. With the Winkler modification to the Jaro
metric, the Jaro-Winkler distance also adds an increase in similarity four words which
start with the same letters (prefix).

The Jaro-Winkler distance is a modification of the Jaro similarity metric, which
measures the similarity between two strings. The Jaro similarity is 1.0 when strings are 
identical and 0 when strings have no letters in common. Distance measures such as the 
Jaro distance or Jaro-Winkler distance, on the other hand, are 0 when strings are 
identical and 1 when they have no letters in common.

The Jaro similarity of two strings, <math>sim\sub{j}</math>, is defined as

: <math>d_j = \left\{

\begin{array}{l l}
  0 & \text{if }m = 0\\
  \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m}{|s_1|} + \frac{m}{|s_2|} + \frac{m-t}{m}\right) & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.</math>

Where:

* <math>m</math> &nbsp; is the number of ''matching characters'';
* <math>t</math> &nbsp; is half the number of ''transpositions (shared characters in different positions in the word)''.

If we define the number of initial (prefix) characters in common as

<math>L</math> = the length of a common prefix between strings, up to 4 characters

and select a parameter to define the amount a common beginning influences the similarity
which Winkler suggests to be 0.1:

<math> p </math> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0.1

Then the Jaro-Winkler distance can be defined as 

<math>distance\sub{w} = 1 - similarity{w}</math>

where <math>similarity{w} = similarity{j} + lp(1 - sim\sub{j}</math>


To calculate the Jaro-Winkler distance, the Jaro similarity is first calculated 
according to the formula

: <math>d_j = \left\{

\begin{array}{l l}
  0 & \text{if }m = 0\\
  \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m}{|s_1|} + \frac{m}{|s_2|} + \frac{m-t}{m}\right) & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.</math>

where

* <math>m</math> &nbsp; is the number of ''matching characters'';
* <math>t</math> &nbsp; is half the number of ''transpositions (shared characters in different positions in the word)''.


The Jaro similarity is near 1.0 when the distance between the two words is small.
The Jaro distance is thus defined as 1 - the Jaro similarity:



The Jaro distance is 0.0 if the words are identical and 1.0 if the words do not share
any common letters.



The Winkler modification is based upon the number of common letters at the start of the two words,
times a constant for the strength of the addition, which Winkler originally set at 0.1,
which is then multiplied by the gyro distance. This product is then added to the original Jaro similarity.


Finally, the Jaro-WInkler distance is defined a 1.0 minus the Jaro-Winkler similarity:


String metrics such as Jaro-Winkler distance are useful in applications such as spelling checkers,
because letter transpositions are common typing errors and humans tend to misspell the middle portions
of words more often than their beginnings.  This may help a spelling checker program to generate
better alternatives for misspelled word replacement.

;The task:

Using a dictionary of your choice and the following list of 9 commonly misspelled words:

* "accomodate​", "definately​", "goverment​", "occured", 
* "publically", "recieve​", "seperate", "untill​", "wich​"

*  Calculate the Jaro-Winkler distance between the misspelled word and words in the dictionary.

*  Use this distance to list close alternatives (at least two per word) to the misspelled words.

*  Show the calculated distances between the misspelled words and their potential replacements.
